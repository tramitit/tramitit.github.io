## üöÄ Build And Deploy

### üëâ Build Command

To build your project locally, you can use the following command. It will purge all the unused CSS and minify all the files.

```bash
npm run build
```

And if you want to Host some other hosting platforms. then you can build your project, and you will get a `public` folder. that you can copy and paste on your hosting platform.

for example the Python oneliner from the root of the project (i.e. where this readmefile is located) is sufficient to serve the website:
```
python3 -m http.server -d ./public/
```

> **Note:** You must change the `baseURL` in the `hugo.toml` file. Otherwise, your site will not work properly.
